# DESCRIPTION: Sense function for a robot-localizer
# PARAMETERS:
# 1) color: the observation that was just made
# 2) grid: a 2D-grid representation of the world
# 3) beliefs: a probability-distribution of initial new_beliefs
# 4) p_hit: probability of making a correct observation of 'color'
# 5) p_miss: probability of making an incorrect observation of 'color'
# RETURNS: updated probability-distribution of beliefs
def sense(color, grid, beliefs, p_hit, p_miss):
    new_beliefs = []

    #
    # TODO - implement this in part 2
    #

    return new_beliefs
